#L'énigme-internet

This is the first episode of (Ihope to bea series) of internet riddles - l'énigme-internet wich I made initially for my fiance.

The main purpose is to create fun and engaging way to practice programming and/or spend time with pleasure. 

Althogh, I'm focusing on Java, Bash and Python any other language could be used as well.
